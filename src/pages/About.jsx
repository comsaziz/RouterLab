          JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily used for
          enhancing web pages to provide interactive features. It allows
          developers to create dynamic content, control multimedia, animate
          images, and much more. JavaScript is an essential part of web
          development, alongside HTML and CSS, and is widely supported by all
          modern web browsers. With the advent of frameworks like React,
          Angular, and Vue.js, JavaScript has also become a powerful tool for
          building complex web applications.
